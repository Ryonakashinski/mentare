# My Project

1. This is a MAP WEB application where users can leave their comment on the map and others also can see their comments.
   So far, user can leave their comments on their location, but I can see their latitude and longitude.

Need to delete those, and add time. and decorate the comment box to bubble with color azure.

Need to keep their comments on the map unless they delete.
